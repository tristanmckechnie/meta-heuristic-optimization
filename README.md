# meta-heuristic-optimization
Playing around with metaheuristic optimization algorithms; GAs, PSOs, Simulated Anealing, multi-objective optimization, local searches etc.

Look through the three notebooks:
- PBA1: local search, genetic algorithm, knapsack problem, travelling salesmen problem
- PBA2: multi-objective optimization, dominance based simulated anealling, with additional variations.
- PBA3: Particle swarm optimization and multi-level optimization. Optimization of mathematical function with complex decision space(many local minima), and optimization of optimizer's hyperparameters.

Have a look through these notebooks for some cool algorithms implemented from scratch. A showcase of my Python programming ability.
